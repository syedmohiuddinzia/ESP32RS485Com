**1. Max485 Module**

On-board MAX485 chip is a low-power and slew-rate-limited transceiver used for RS485 communication. Adopting Half-Duplex communication to implement the function of converting TTL level info into RS485 level, it can achieve a maximum transmission rate of 2.5 Mbps. 
MAX485 PinoutDepending on RE and DE connection, the module works as receiver or transmitter.  Connected to VCC transmits data and connected to GND receives data. 
The MAX485 Module is cheap. You can find lots of 5 unit for less than one euro.

# Serial Communication

RS-485, also known as TIA-485(-A) or EIA-485, is a standard defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial communications systems. Electrical signaling is balanced, and multipoint systems are supported. The standard is jointly published by the Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries Alliance (TIA/EIA). Digital communications networks implementing the standard can be used effectively over long distances and in electrically noisy environments. Multiple receivers may be connected to such a network in a linear, multidrop bus. These characteristics make RS-485 useful in industrial control systems and similar applications.
